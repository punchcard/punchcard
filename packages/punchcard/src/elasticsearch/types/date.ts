import { timestamp } from '@punchcard/shape';

/**
 * JSON doesnâ€™t have a date data type, so dates in Elasticsearch can either be:
 * - strings containing formatted dates, e.g. `"2015-01-01"` or `"2015/01/01 12:10:30"`.
 * - a long number representing milliseconds-since-the-epoch
 * - an integer representing seconds-since-the-epoch.
 *
 * Internally, dates are converted to UTC (if the time-zone is specified) and stored as a long number representing milliseconds-since-the-epoch.
 *
 * Queries on dates are internally converted to range queries on this long representation, and the result of aggregations and stored fields is converted back to a string depending on the date format that is associated with the field.
 *
 * Dates will always be rendered as strings, even if they were initially supplied as a long in the JSON document.
 *
 * Date formats can be customised, but if no format is specified then it uses the default: `strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis"`
 *
 * This means that it will accept dates with optional timestamps, which conform to the formats supported by strict_date_optional_time or milliseconds-since-the-epoch.
 *
 * @see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/date.html
