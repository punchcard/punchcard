## Punchcard

Punchcard is a TypeScript framework for building cloud applications atop the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk). It unifies **Infrastructure Code** with **Runtime Code**, meaning you can both declare resources and implement logic within the context of one node.js application. AWS resources are thought of as generic, type-safe objects — DynamoDB Tables are like a `Map<K, V>`; SNS Topics, SQS Queues, and Kinesis Streams feel like an `Array<T>`; and a Lambda Function is akin to a `Function<A, B>` – like the standard library of a programming language.

## Hello, World!

Running code in AWS is almost as simple as running it locally!
```ts

const app = new Core.App();

const stack = app.root.map(app => new cdk.Stack(app, 'hello, world!'));

const topic: SNS.Topic<StringShape> = new SNS.Topic(this, 'Topic', {
  shape: string()
});

Lambda.schedule(this, 'SendNotification', {
  rate: Schedule.rate(Duration.minutes(1)),
  depends: topic,
  handle: async(event, topic) => {
    await topic.publish('Hello, World!');
  }
});

const queue = topic.toSQSQueue(this, 'Queue');

queue.messages().forEach(this, 'ForEachMessge', {
  handle: async(message) => console.log(`message '${message}' has length ${message.length}`);
});
```

## Example Stacks

* [Stream Processing](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard/blob/master/examples/lib/stream-processing.ts) - respond to SNS notifications with a Lambda Function; subscribe notifications to a SQS Queue and process them with a Lambda Function; process and forward data from a SQS Queue to a Kinesis Stream; sink records from the Stream to S3 and catalog it in a Glue Table.
* [Invoke a Function from another Function](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard/blob/master/examples/lib/invoke-function.ts) - call a Function from another Function
* [Real-Time Data Lake](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard/blob/master/examples/lib/data-lake.ts) - collects data with Kinesis and persists to S3, exposed as a Glue Table in a Glue Database.
* [Scheduled Lambda Function](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard/blob/master/examples/lib/scheduled-function.ts) - runs a Lambda Function every minute and stores data in a DynamoDB Table.
* [Pet Store API Gateway](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard/blob/master/examples/lib/pet-store-apigw.ts) - implementation of the [Pet Store API Gateway canonical example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-from-example.html).
